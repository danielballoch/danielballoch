  Daniel Balloch Portfolio
</h1>
<p>Made with Gatsby, React, GraphQL, Styled Emotion & Netlify.</p>
<p>This was a quick two week project with planning in word, prototyping in adobe xd and coding in VSC (html, JavaScript, css, React)</p>
<p>Page Animations were a new skill I added to my tool kit through this project, although the transitions added are fairly simple I think they
match the clean design and purpose of the site, although I'm excited to expirement further.</p>
<p>Install & local host instructions:
    <ol>
        <li> git clone https://github.com/danielballoch/danielballoch.git</li>
        <li> npm install </li>
        <li> gatsby develop</li>
    </ol>
    Keep in mind I'm still learning myself, so these may not be best practises.
    If anyones curious as to how something works flick me a message or if you have advice for me I'd love to hear it,
    otherwise happy coding!
</p>
