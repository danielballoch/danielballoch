intro1: "
This project was for a local plumbing company starting up right here in Hamilton. Unfortunatly the owner has decided to shut down shop with issues arriving around covid, however I went ahead and completed the website for my own learning. The full site is live at https://pascoes.danielballoch.com/ and complete with CMS Integration, meaning site content such as contact information or any other site copy can be easily updated without a developer or any stress.
"

intro2: "
Create a trustworthy online presence for Pascoeâ€™s Plumbing & Gas, where prospective clients can view a short video introduction, see services available, view past work, get an idea of the company, see contact details or request a quote.

"

intro3: "
3-4 cycles of reseach/prototype, proposal and feedback to hone in on what Pascoes Plumbing is about, site requirments, brand details and a fitting design we were both happy with." 

intro4: "
The whole process was documented in google docs so I could learn from the experience and easily gather feedback, we ended with pages: Home, About, Services, Contact/Quote and Features: contact details, quote form, work coverage area etc. Designs were proposed and iterated along the way through docs and inVision.

paragraph1_1: "
This was a good chance for me to work on my people skills, get better at figuring out what a client needs, what they want and how I can present, gather feedback and create win-win relationships. 
"

paragraph1_2: "
I ended up doing a lot of research and I really tried to get a decent idea of the business so I could make suggestions and have minimal thinking and alterations on the part of my client since I know he's a busy man, although there's still lot's of improvements to make for next time.
"

paragraph1_3: "
The full site was prototyped and designed on Adobe XD, starting with a simple aim, site story, features and hierarchy, to simple boxes/text and all the way to a fully specified design with fonts, colors, images, layout etc all defined - if the project is picked back up all that's left to do is code the site and agree on animations.
"

paragraph1_4: "
This was a awesome learning experience where I got to do my first full project with a client. In total it took me 44 working hours, which isn't bad at all although that was spread over some time. I learnt a lot about prototyping, design, working with a client etc and definitely enjoyed the experience. If you would have any questions, feedback, critique or would like to work with me I'd love to hear from you though the info below!
