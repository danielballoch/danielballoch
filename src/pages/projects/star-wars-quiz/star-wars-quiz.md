intro1: "The Starwars quiz app was a quick project which I used to better understand pulling data from apis. I started 'The Complete Web Developer in 2020' course and this was one of the optional challenges before learning more about back end development. It's fairly simply quiz style app which uses swapi api data and matches users to a starwars species based data from a short form."
intro2: "Create a interactive app using the swapi api within a couple days."
intro3: "
I checked out the data availible and brainstormed ideas before deciding on a quiz. After this I made a mvp, added to gh-pages and then updated styles and etc to make it look a bit nicer. " 

intro4: "
The styling off this app was aimed at staying true to the Starwars universe, the hero image shows a few different characters and colors representing their achtype are intermixed. I aimed to get the user ready to reveal there own archtype and draw them into the quiz more with this. Multiple choice buttons (young, old, ancient) etc reduce form completion time and keep the user engaged, while the eye color and hair dropdowns display a large number of options, without compromising design.

heading1: "App Development"

paragraph1_1: "
The app was coded to be responsive, although it was a quick one so It didn't have full fledged prototypes, a simple txt document and an idea in my head is all I worked from. I kept the features minimal so I could start learning more about the full stack sooner and make projects which I would be more excited about."

paragraph1_2: "
How does it work?
The app is fairly simple and includes 4 basic stages. 1: data grabbed from api and converted to json. 2: user form is filled (or left prefilled) and submitted, inputs are added to state. 3: a result is chosen via if statments and relevant img stored in state. 4: props (state) sent to resultTemplate page and page is displayed "

paragraph1_3: "
 I could have made this app look better and wanted to add page transitions, animation, image optimization, extra features etc but opted to leave as is and continue on learning new things rather than spending more time on this, although it did serve it's purpose and for a small project it's not bad. If you have any feedback or questions I'd love to hear from you, Daniel. "
