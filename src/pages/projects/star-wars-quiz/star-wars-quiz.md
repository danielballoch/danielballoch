intro1: "The Starwars quiz app was a quick project, which I used to better understand pulling data from apis, as well as github branches, merging, pull requests and gt-pages. I started 'The Complete Web Developer in 2020' course and this was one of the optional challenges before learning more about back end development. It's fairly simply quiz style app which uses swapi api data and matches users to a Starwars species based data from a short form."
intro2: "Create a interactive app using the swapi api within a couple days."
intro3: "
I checked out the data available and brainstormed ideas before deciding on a quiz. After this I made an mvp and added to gh-pages, before updating styles and getting underway with the meat of the project." 

intro4: "
The styling of this app was aimed at staying true to the Starwars universe, the hero image shows a few different characters, and colors representing their archetype are intermixed. I aimed to get the user to question where they would fit amongst these popular characters and draw them into the quiz. Multiple choice buttons (young, old, ancient) etc. reduce form completion time and keep the user engaged, while the eye color and hair drop-downs display a large number of options, without compromising design.

heading1: "Front End App Development"

paragraph1_1: "
The app was coded to be responsive, although it was a quick one so It didn't have full fledged prototypes, a simple text document and an idea in my head is all I worked from. I kept the features minimal, so I could start learning more about the full stack sooner and make projects which I would be more excited about."

paragraph1_2: "
How does it work?
The app is fairly simple and includes 4 basic stages. 1: data grabbed from api and converted to json. 2: user form is filled (or left pre-filled) and submitted, inputs are added to state. 3: a result is chosen via if statements and relevant image stored in state. 4: props (state) sent to resultTemplate page and page is displayed "

paragraph1_3: "
Creating a logo in photoshop was quite fun. I used the same Starwars font as the apps hero text and blended in the outline style. I also stuck with the same colors from the app to keep branding consistent. A black eclipse was masked with a faded gradient and I overlayed a few layers with brush marks, playing with the blending options and adding an outer glow, as well as some color here and there, to give the impression of stars."

paragraph1_4: "
I could have made this app look better and wanted to add features such as page transitions, animation, image optimization, etc. but opted to leave as is and continue on learning new things rather than spending more time on this, although it did serve its purpose. I learnt more about git, apis and I'm excited to learn more! If you have any feedback or questions I'd love to hear from you, Daniel.
